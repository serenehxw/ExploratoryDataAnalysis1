Exploratory Data Analysis
=========================

This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis". 
There are 8 files for the Course Project 1.
4 Png Files and 4 R scripts

To run this script you need to to the following:
* Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R);
* Data can be download from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
* Extract the data into a subdirectory;
* Run the scripts
